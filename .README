# Simple Ball Roll - Godot Game Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Simple Ball Roll project! This is a beginner-friendly project developed using the Godot Engine, designed to demonstrate basic physics and collision interactions in a 3D environment. The primary objective of this project is to create a simple ball that rolls and collides on a surface, providing a foundational understanding of game physics and Godot's capabilities.

## Features

- **Rolling Ball**: A 3D sphere that rolls across a surface based on physics simulations.
- **Collision Detection**: The ball can collide with various objects in the environment.
- **User Interaction**: Basic input controls to interact with the ball (e.g., apply force or change direction).
- **Simple Environment**: A basic 3D plane serves as the surface for the ball to roll on.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) (version 3.5 or later recommended)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mattsimoessilva/move-dodge-game.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project**:
   - Launch the Godot Engine.
   - Click on the "Import" button and navigate to the directory where the project is cloned.
   - Select the `project.godot` file and click "Open".

3. **Run the Project**:
   - Once the project is open in Godot, press the "Play" button or press `F5` to start the game.

## Controls

- **Mouse/Keyboard**: 
  - Use the mouse or arrow keys to control the ball's movement.

## Project Structure

- `res://assets/`: Contains all the scene files.
- `res://scripts/`: Contains all the GDScript files used for game logic.
- `res://imports/`: Contains assets like textures, models, and sounds.
